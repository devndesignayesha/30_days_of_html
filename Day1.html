<!--The <!DOCTYPE> Declaration
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.

It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is:

<!DOCTYPE html> -->

<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- The <html> element is the root element and it defines the whole HTML document.

It has a start tag <html> and an end tag </html>.

Then, inside the <html> element there is a <body> element-->


<html lang="en">


<!-- The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.

HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.

Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.-->

<head>
    <!-- The HTML <meta> Element
The <meta> element is typically used to specify the character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.

The metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), by search engines (keywords), and other web services.

Examples
Define the character set used:

<meta charset="UTF-8">
Define keywords for search engines:

<meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript">
Define a description of your web page:

<meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials">
Define the author of a page:

<meta name="author" content="John Doe">
Refresh document every 30 seconds:

<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30">
Setting the viewport to make your website look good on all devices:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> -->


    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!-- The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device - it will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.

You should include the following <meta> element in all your web pages:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
This gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.

The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.

Here is an example of a web page without the viewport meta tag, and the same web page with the viewport meta tag:
-->

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">


    <!-- The <title> element defines the title of the document. The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.

The <title> element is required in HTML documents!

The content of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO)! The page title is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.

The <title> element:

defines a title in the browser toolbar
provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
displays a title for the page in search engine-results
So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible!-->

    <!-- The <style> element is used to define style information for a single HTML page:

Example
<style>
  body {background-color: powderblue;}
  h1 {color: red;}
  p {color: blue;}
</style> -->

    <!-- The <link> element defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource.

The <link> tag is most often used to link to external style sheets:

Example
<link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">-->
</head>

<body>

</body>

</html>
